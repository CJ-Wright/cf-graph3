It is very likely that the current package version for this feedstock is out of date or needed migration.\n\nList of changes done to the recipe:\nRenamed build with host\nMoving `python # [win]` which was used for vc matrix\nRemoving toolchain in favour of compiler()\nMoving cmake from host to build\nRemoving pinnings for hdf5 to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving vc features\nRemoving features section as it is empty\nAdding C compiler\nAdding C++ compiler\nChanged py2k in selector # [win32 or (win and py2k) and py36] to vc<14\n\n*If you have recived a `Migrate to Jinja2 compiler syntax` PR from me recently please close that one and use this one*.\nNotes and instructions for merging this PR:\n1. Please merge the PR only after the tests have passed. \n2. Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed. \nIf you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\n\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!
