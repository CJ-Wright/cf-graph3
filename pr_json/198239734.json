It is very likely that the current package version for this feedstock is out of date or needed migration.\n\nList of changes done to the recipe:\nRenamed build with host\nMoving `python # [win]` which was used for vc matrix\nMoving cmake from host to build\nRemoving toolchain in favour of compiler()\nRemoving vc in favour of compiler()\nRemoved skip for one of py35 or py36 as it's used for vc skipping\nRemoving vc features\nRemoving features section as it is empty\nAdding C compiler\nAdding C++ compiler\nChanged py27 in selector # [win and py27] to vc<14\n\n*If you have recived a `Migrate to Jinja2 compiler syntax` PR from me recently please close that one and use this one*.\nNotes and instructions for merging this PR:\n1. Please merge the PR only after the tests have passed. \n2. Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed. \nIf you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\n\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!
