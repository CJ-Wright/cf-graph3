    "body": "This PR was created by the [cf-regro-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\n\nThe **cf-regro-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. It is very likely that the current package version for this feedstock is out of date or needed migration.\n\nList of changes done to the recipe:\nRenamed build with host\nRemoving toolchain in favour of compiler()\nMoving cmake from host to build\nMoving ninja from host to build\nRemoving pinnings for expat to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving pinnings for hdf5 to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving pinnings for jpeg to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving pinnings for libtiff to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving pinnings for libpng to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nRemoving pinnings for zlib to use values from conda_build_config.yaml\nMoving `python # [win]` which was used for vc matrix\nRemoving vc in favour of compiler()\nRemoved skip for one of py35 or py36 as it's used for vc skipping\nRemoving vc features\nRemoving features section as it is empty\nAdding Fortran compiler\nAdding C compiler\nAdding C++ compiler\n\n*If you have recived a `Migrate to Jinja2 compiler syntax` PR from me recently please close that one and use this one*.\nNotes and instructions for merging this PR:\n1. Please merge the PR only after the tests have passed. \n2. Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed. \nIf you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\n\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!
