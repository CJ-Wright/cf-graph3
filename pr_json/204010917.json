Please merge the PR only after the tests have passed. \n2. Feel free to push to the bot's branch to update this PR if needed. \n3. If this recipe has a `cython` dependency please note that only a `C` compiler has been added. If the project also needs a `C++` compiler please add it by adding `- { compiler('cxx') }` to the build section \n\n<sub>This PR was created by the [cf-regro-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\nThe **cf-regro-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. If you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!</sub>",
