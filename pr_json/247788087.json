The bot will almost always only open one PR per version. \n\n\nIf this PR was opened in error or needs to be updated please add the `bot-rerun` label to this PR. The bot will close this PR and schedule another one.\n\n<sub>This PR was created by the [cf-regro-autotick-bot](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts).\nThe **cf-regro-autotick-bot** is a service to automatically track the dependency graph, migrate packages, and propose package version updates for conda-forge. If you would like a local version of this bot, you might consider using [rever](https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/). Rever is a tool for automating software releases and forms the backbone of the bot's conda-forge PRing capability. Rever is both conda (`conda install -c conda-forge rever`) and pip (`pip install re-ver`) installable.\nFinally, feel free to drop us a line if there are any [issues](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues)!</sub>\n\nHere is a list of all the pending dependencies (and their versions) for this repo.
